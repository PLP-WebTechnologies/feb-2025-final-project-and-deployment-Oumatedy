## 🔄 Suggested Folder Reorganization

To improve maintainability and scalability, consider **restructuring** your project like this:

### 🔹 **Separate reusable components**
- Move **header.html** and **footer.html** into a `components/` folder to ensure consistent rendering across pages.

### 🔹 **Organize pages logically**
- Place all standalone pages (**index.html, about.html, products.html, etc.**) inside a `pages/` folder for clarity.

### 🔹 **Centralize assets**
- Store CSS and JavaScript files in an `assets/` directory to keep styles and functionality separate from content.

### 🔹 **Consider a framework upgrade**
- If your project grows, upgrading to **React, Vue, or Next.js** can simplify component reuse and enhance maintainability.
